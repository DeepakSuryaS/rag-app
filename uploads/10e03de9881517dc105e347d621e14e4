## Highlights

> Disruption mania can be traced back to 1997, when Clayton Christensen coined the term ‚Äúdisruptive innovation‚Äù and laid out a predictive theory of why formerly successful companies fail in his book, _The Innovator‚Äôs Dilemma_ [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/death-by-a-thousand-cuts-18892bc9026#7e9ac0b5-bdcb-4908-be5f-59e5fa2e089a) 

> Education, healthcare, and museums are all fair game to Christensen. This [lends nicely](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31713240.358489/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy83TXI%5FbWJjaWQ9MzE3MTMyNDAuMzU4NDg5Jm1pZD1hN2EzMGZkMzMwOGQ5MThlOWJjZDYwYTcxOTM1NmE2NCZtYmxpZD02NDQ4N2JhYWRiY2U/647f57557909890704100155Baf8516cb) to top-down free markets over public goods‚Äîand taxpayers end up with subpar results.
> 
> Unfortunately, disruptive innovation theory isn‚Äôt entirely reliable, as explained in the [New Yorker](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31713240.358489/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy83TXM%5FbWJjaWQ9MzE3MTMyNDAuMzU4NDg5Jm1pZD1hN2EzMGZkMzMwOGQ5MThlOWJjZDYwYTcxOTM1NmE2NCZtYmxpZD0yNTAyZjdjMzczMDg/647f57557909890704100155B48608468). For example, Christensen predicted in 2007 that the iPhone would be a failure for Apple. Better luck next time!

> But even Silicon Valley has a limited tolerance for disruption. Former startups turned corporate giants now either [buy out or crush competitors](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31713240.358489/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy83TXQ%5FbWJjaWQ9MzE3MTMyNDAuMzU4NDg5Jm1pZD1hN2EzMGZkMzMwOGQ5MThlOWJjZDYwYTcxOTM1NmE2NCZtYmxpZD03NGZiZDhiZTlkODQ/647f57557909890704100155Be5bf892e) (not very ‚Äútech utopia‚Äù of them). Venture capital firms (VCs) now steer clear of the ‚Äúkill zone,‚Äù or spheres they feel existing tech companies will squish or buy out of the market.

> And then there are the tech workers who don‚Äôt get nap pods and game lounges: Amazon drivers [pee in bottles](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31713240.358489/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy83TXU%5FbWJjaWQ9MzE3MTMyNDAuMzU4NDg5Jm1pZD1hN2EzMGZkMzMwOGQ5MThlOWJjZDYwYTcxOTM1NmE2NCZtYmxpZD03NWQ2YTNmNWY1NDk/647f57557909890704100155Bfea1cce0), fearing they won‚Äôt meet the grueling productivity quotas. [Kenyan workers](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31713240.358489/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy83TXY%5FbWJjaWQ9MzE3MTMyNDAuMzU4NDg5Jm1pZD1hN2EzMGZkMzMwOGQ5MThlOWJjZDYwYTcxOTM1NmE2NCZtYmxpZD02NDQ3ZmYyNzAwYzc/647f57557909890704100155B66cf5915) earn less than $2 an hour to review violence, hate speech, and sexual abuse content to train OpenAI algorithms.

> Although the biggest benefit of tech disruption is wealth creation, that wealth is reserved for shareholders.‚Äî_Myriam_ [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/death-by-a-thousand-cuts-18892bc9026#a889b1c6-9863-495d-ab42-dbfe958530a1)
